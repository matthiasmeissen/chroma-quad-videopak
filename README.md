# Chroma Quad Videopak

A videopak for the teenage engineering op-z.


## Intro

Venture into a world of refraction with the "Chroma Quad Videopak", an interactive experience that illuminates the realm of color and form.

Wander through a surreal landscape where each object represents a distinct shade and shape, viewed through a refractive body to evoke a spectrum of emotions. As you interact with these objects, you will be drawn into the dynamic interplay of sound, color, and emotion, where each element seamlessly blends together to create a harmonious symphony.

With a select few parameters, you can personalize your journey and delve into a kaleidoscope of sensory wonder, where the beauty of emotion is expressed through the artistry of light and sound.


## How to install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/matthiasmeissen/chroma-quad-videopak/releases/tag/1.0.0) and install it in the op-z app.


## How to use

This videopak lets you explore four sound objects that each represent different shades and shapes.  
To switch between them use button 1 on the motion track.

You can use the kaleidoscope to get immersed by the interplay of rythm and colour.  
To toggle kaleidoscope use button 2 on the motion track.

By tweaking a few selected parameters you can dive deep into the experience and make it your won.  
To change the parameters turn one of the four knobs on page 1 of the motion track.

The rest of the pak reacts to the music that is playing.
