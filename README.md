# Chroma Quad Videopak

## Intro

Venture into a world of abstraction with the "Chroma Quad Videopak", an interactive experience that illuminates the realm of color and form.

Wander through a surreal landscape where each object represents a distinct shade and shape, evoking a spectrum of emotions.
